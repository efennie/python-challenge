Part one: Bank Data (PyBank folder)
The code in main.py runs some basic analysis on revenue data that is stored in a csv file under the resources folder.

The main.py file imports the csv file, reads it, and calculates the total gains/losses, the average change in gains/losses over time, finds the month and year associated with the maximum gains in profits, and finds the month and year associated with the minimum gains in profit.

The main.py code will then export the calculations into a text file named analysis.txt inside the analysis folder within the PyBank folder.

Part two: Election Results (PyPoll folder)
The code in main.py calculates election results from poll data that is stored in a csv file under the resources folder.

The main.py code in this folder will import the csv file, read it, and calculate the total votes cast, votes per candidate, percentage of votes won per candidate, and will determine the winner by comparing the votes per candidate and finding the maximum value. 

Finally, the main.py code will export our election results into a new text file named analysis.txt within the analysis folder inside of the PyPoll folder.
